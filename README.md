Implementation of the searchable product data table walkthrough from the React website

To implement a UI in React, you usually follow the same five steps:

1. Break the UI into a component hierarchy

2. Build a static version in React

3. Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state

4. Identify where your state should live

5. Add inverse data flow
